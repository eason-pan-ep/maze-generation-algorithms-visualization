# Maze-generation-algorithms-visualization

### Visualizing Prim's, Kruskal's and hunt-and-kill algorithm to generate mazes, coursework for CS5800 - Algorithms

## Goals
- Implement these algorithms that can generate mazes with different sizes
- Implement visualizations of the maze generation and show how a maze is gradually generated

## How to Run
get to the program's main directory in the terminal and run `python3 maze_generation_algorithms_visualization.py`.

For Prim's algorithm (turtle has been imported):
- Go to the `prims` directory.
- Run 'maze.py' in terminal.
- Input an integer (the side length of the square maze the user wants).

For Kruskal's Algorithm:
- Go to the `kruskal` directory.
- Run `main.py`.
- Input `Width` and `Height` when prompted.

## Required Package
Tkinter

## Limitations
- code is not yet optimized for error prevention and error handling
