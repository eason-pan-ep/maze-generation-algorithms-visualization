# Hunt-and-kill-algorithm-visualization

### Using the hunt-and-kill algorithm to generate mazes, coursework for CS5800 - Algorithms

## Goals
- Implement the hunt-and-kill algorithm that can generate mazes with different sizes
- Implement visualizations of the maze generation and show how a maze is gradually generated

## How to Run
get to the program's main directory in the terminal and run `python3 hunt_and_kill_visualization.py`.

## Required Package
Tkinter

## Limitations
- code is not yet optimized for error prevention and error handling
