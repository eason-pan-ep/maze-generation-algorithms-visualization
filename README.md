# Maze-generation-algorithms-visualization

### Visualizing Prim's, Kruskal's and hunt-and-kill algorithm to generate mazes, coursework for CS5800 - Algorithms

## Goals
- Implement these algorithms that can generate mazes with different sizes
- Implement visualizations of the maze generation and show how a maze is gradually generated

## How to Run
get to the program's main directory in the terminal and run `python3 maze_generation_algorithms_visualization.py`.

For Prim's algorithm:
(turtle has been imported)
- Open terminal, run 'python3 maze.py'.
- Input an integer (the side length of the square maze the user wants).

## Required Package
Tkinter

## Limitations
- code is not yet optimized for error prevention and error handling
